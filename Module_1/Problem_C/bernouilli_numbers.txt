Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, better known as Ada Lovelace, was born in London in 1815, the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron. A friend of Charles Babbage, she followed his work on the Analytical Engine with great interest. In fact, they worked closely together, with her focusing on what we would now call software and him mainly on hardware. It was Ada who described the first algorithm in history designed specifically to be executed by a "computer," even though such a machine had not yet been invented. This algorithm was dedicated to calculating Bernoulli numbers, named after Abraham de Moivre, in honor of Jakob Bernoulli, the first mathematician to study them. Bernoulli numbers also appear in the expansion of the tangent and hyperbolic tangent functions through Taylor series, in the Euler-Maclaurin formula, and in the expressions for certain values of the Riemann zeta function.

One of the uses of Bernoulli numbers is in calculating Faulhaber's formula, or the sum of the first (N) natural numbers raised to a constant power (P):

1^P +2^P +3^P +⋯+N^P
 
Given the values of (N) and (P), your task is to write a program to calculate, not the value of this sum, but the remainder when this sum is divided by 49,999.

Why this remainder? Because depending on the values of (N) and (P), the sum can be very large. Remember that the remainder (also known as the modulus) of the sum is equal to the modulus of the sum of the remainders, and the same holds true for products:

(a+b)%k=((a%k)+(b%k))%k

(a×b)%k=((a%k)×(b%k))%k

Input
The first line of input contains the number C of test cases, no more than 10,000. Then, C lines follow, each containing the values of N and P separated by a space (1 ≤ N, P ≤ 100).

Output
The output should have C lines, each with the corresponding result.
