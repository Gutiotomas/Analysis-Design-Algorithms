A palindrome number (from the Catalan cap i cua, meaning head and tail) refers to a natural number with two or more digits that reads the same from left to right as from right to left, i.e., it is a palindromic number.

Now, let’s take any natural number, for example, 75. Reverse the order of its digits and add the resulting number to 75:

75+57=132

Now do the same with 132:

132+231=363

In this case, after two iterations, we arrive at a palindrome number.

Let’s try another number, for example, 145:

145+541=686

In this case, we arrive at a palindrome number in just one iteration.

What does this have to do with Lycherel numbers? Well, so-called Lycherel numbers are those natural numbers with two or more digits that are not palindromes and, moreover, do not become palindromes through the iterative process described above.

Do Lycherel numbers exist? The truth is, we don’t know. The only certain thing is that it hasn’t been proven that they don’t exist. The most famous case is that of the number 196 (http://www.p19.org/196). In 1987, John Walker designed a program to discover whether 196 could become a palindrome, and after 2,415,836 iterations, the program had reached a number with a million digits without finding a palindrome. In 2006, Wade VanLandingham did the same and, after 2,747,659,676 iterations, reached a number of 300 million digits without finding a palindrome.

And why are they called Lycherel numbers? Because VanLandingham himself named them as a kind of anagram of Cheryl, his girlfriend’s name.

Input
The input contains several test cases, no more than 1,000. Each case corresponds to a line containing a positive integer with at least two digits and less than 10,000. The input ends with a value of 0, which does not correspond to a test case.

Output
For each test case, the output should contain a line with the number of iterations required to reach a palindrome number. However, since the infamous 196 or other similar numbers might appear, if during the reverse-and-add process a value equal to or greater than 1E10 is reached, a message 'L' (without quotes) should be displayed to indicate the suspicion of a Lycherel number.
