Given an arbitrary sequence of 𝑁 integers (not necessarily distinct) 𝑎1,𝑎2,...,𝑎𝑁, we are interested in all 
possible pairs of numbers (𝑎𝑖,𝑎𝑗) where 1≤𝑖,𝑗≤𝑁. In other words, we are interested in all 𝑁^2  pairs that 
result from this sequence.

For example, for the sequence {3,1,4}, we would be interested in the following 9 pairs:
(3, 3), (3, 1), (3, 4), (1, 3), (1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 3), (4, 1), (4, 4)

But additionally, we want these pairs to be ordered in ascending order. A pair (𝑝1,𝑞1) is less than the pair 
(𝑝2,𝑞2) if and only if 𝑝1<𝑝2, or 𝑝1=𝑝2 and 𝑞1<𝑞2.

Thus, the pairs described above should appear in the following order:
(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4)

If we number these sorted pairs from 1 to 𝑁^2, the task is to find the 𝑘-th pair in this sequence.

Input
The first line of the input contains two numbers 𝑁 and 𝑘 separated by a space (1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 100,000, 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑁^2). The next 
𝑁 lines contain the sequence of numbers, each in the range [−10^9,10^9], and they are not necessarily distinct.

Output
In a single line, separated by a space, print the two numbers that correspond to the 𝑘-th pair.

Example:
Input
3 2
3
1
4

Output
1 3
