This was one of the largest centers of knowledge dissemination in Antiquity. It was established in the 3rd century BC,
and it is estimated that it housed more than 400,000 literary, academic, and religious volumes. Among the famous 
scholars of its time, it had contributions from Eratosthenes, Archimedes, and Euclid.

At that time, the librarians didn't have social networks, so when they weren't working, they dedicated themselves 
to a particular game: they would take any book with 
𝑀
M pages and search for the page number where, if they added up the number of digits of each page number from 1 to 
that page (inclusive), it would be the same as the sum of the digits of the following pages. If no page satisfied 
this property, they would look for the page with the largest value for which the sum of digits up to that page was 
less than the sum of digits of the following pages.

So, for example, if the book has 𝑀=102 pages, the page number sought will be 54, as the sum of digits up to that 
page is 99, which is equal to the sum of the digits of the following pages. On the other hand, if the book has 
𝑀=50 pages, the sought page number will be 27, as the sum of digits up to that page is 45, and the sum of 
digits of the following pages is 46.

Input
The input contains multiple test cases, no more than 20,000. Each test case is presented in a line containing 
the value of 𝑀 (1 < M < 10^{10}). The input ends with a value of 0, which is not a test case.

Output
For each test case, the output must contain a line with the sought page number.
