Have you ever participated in a programming marathon? Do you know how the scoring is calculated? 
It turns out that teams (which must have between one and three participants) are ranked in descending 
order based on the number of problems solved (the more, the better) and then in ascending order based 
on the accumulated penalty times (the less, the better).

A marathon generally has between 8 and 12 problems. If several teams tie both in the number of problems 
solved and penalty time, they are considered tied but are displayed in the ranking in ascending order 
according to their team number.

A problem is considered solved by a team if any of the team's submissions for that problem is judged as correct. 
The penalty time for a problem is calculated as the number of minutes it took the team to get the first correct 
submission for that problem, plus 20 minutes for each incorrect submission received prior to the first correct submission. 
Unsolved problems do not incur penalty times, and if a team has more than one correct submission for the same problem, 
only the first is considered. Incorrect submissions after a correct one do not incur a penalty.

Input
The input begins with a positive integer 
𝑀
M, which indicates the number of marathons to follow (1 ≤ M ≤ 50). Then follows the data for each marathon, 
starting with a positive integer 𝑅 (1 ≤ R ≤ 50,000), indicating the number of entries in the marathon's "logbook". 
After this, 𝑅 lines follow with these records, which correspond to the submissions from some or all of the teams for 
problems 1 to 12. There can be up to 1000 teams, numbered consecutively from 1. Each logbook line consists of 
three integers separated by spaces, followed by a letter, also separated by spaces. The first number corresponds 
to the team number, the second to the problem number, and the third to the time in minutes when the submission was made. 
The letter corresponds to the result of the submission and can be one of the following options: C (Correct), 
I (Incorrect), R (Request for clarification), U (Unjudged), or E (Erroneous submission). The last three cases do 
not affect the penalty. The input lines are in the order the submissions were made, and there will always be at 
least one team that solves at least one problem.

Output
For each marathon, there should be one line with the message (without quotes or accents): "maraton i:", where 
𝑖 is the consecutive marathon number. Then, the scoring table for that marathon should be displayed according 
to the procedure previously defined. That is, each row of the table should contain three values separated by spaces: 
the team number, the number of problems solved, and the accumulated penalty time (there should be no space after this value). 
Considering that of the 1000 teams, some may not have participated, done absolutely nothing, or only obtained results
other than "Correct", only those teams that had at least one correct submission should be shown. There should be a 
blank line between the outputs of two consecutive marathons, but there should not be a blank line after the last marathon.
