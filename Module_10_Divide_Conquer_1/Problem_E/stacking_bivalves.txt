Bivalves are a type of mollusk, also called pelecypods, which include around 20,000 species, with some of the most 
well-known being clams and mussels. As the name suggests, they are characterized by having two shells or valves, 
which are joined and articulated at the top edge by a hinge.

It turns out that when Valentina goes to the beach, she enjoys a very particular activity. She searches for shells 
that are as circular as possible and then stacks them into towers, following two strict rules. The first rule is 
that she stacks them one by one in the order she finds them. The second rule is that, to add a shell to a tower, 
the new shell must be strictly smaller than the one at the top of the tower.

If, in the end, Valentina wants to have the fewest number of towers possible, what strategy should she use?

Input
The input begins with a line containing the number of test cases ùê∂ (no more than 10). Then ùê∂ lines follow, 
each containing no more than 100,000 positive integers, each no greater than 1,000,000. These integers 
correspond to the radii of the shells (in millimeters) in the order they were found, separated by spaces.

Output
For each test case, the output should contain a single line with the smallest number of towers possible.

Example:
Input
2
1 2 3 3 4
5 5 5 3 1 3 1 1

Output

3
