Eugenics - from the Greek eugoniké, meaning "good origin," is an ideology that advocates for the improvement of 
human hereditary traits through the selection of individuals and genetic intervention. It is rumored that in the 
mid-20th century, there was a somewhat eccentric scientist obsessed with eugenics research and who was also 
passionate about algorithms. According to him, if he could sequence the entire genetic map of humans 
(which, in reality, was only achieved at the beginning of the 21st century with the Human Genome Project), 
he could easily select the best humans. How? We all know that DNA is composed of chains of four types of 
proteins: A, C, G, and T. His idea was that, given someone's DNA sequence, the more alphabetically ordered it was, 
the better that individual would be.

For example, an individual with the sequence ACCGTT would be considered perfect, while another with the sequence 
CCAGTG would have a "defect level" of 3. This level corresponds to the number of proteins that are out of alphabetical 
order compared to the others (in the example, 'A' is two positions to the right of where it should be, and 'T' is one 
position to the left).

Let's assume we're going to help the scientist select the best M individuals from among N, and we have the DNA 
sequence for each one.

Input
The input begins with a line containing two positive integers separated by a space, N and M (1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 1000). 
Then follow N lines, each containing the DNA sequence of a respective individual: a string composed of a combination 
of between 2 and 4096 characters ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T').

Output
The output should consist of M lines containing the chosen individuals. The first selection criterion is the defect 
level (the lower, the better), and in case of a tie, the sequences are sorted alphabetically.
