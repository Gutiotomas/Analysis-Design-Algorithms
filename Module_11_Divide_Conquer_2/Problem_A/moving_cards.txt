Pedro and Susana love playing with cards, but with a very particular deck: the cards have no suits (hearts, clubs, etc.),
only numbers, and many of them (up to 100,000). One of their favorite games is to shuffle the cards, and then Susana 
starts by swapping two consecutive cards that are not in ascending order. Pedro does the same, and they take turns 
from there on until the deck is completely sorted. The player who makes the last card swap is the winner.

Input
The input consists of a set of test cases, no more than 10. Each test case begins with a line containing the number 
𝑁 of cards (2 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 50,000). Then 𝑁 lines follow, corresponding to the numbers on the cards, all different, 
with values between 1 and 𝑁. The input ends with a line containing 𝑁=0, which should not be processed.

Output
For each test case, you must print in a single line the name of the winner: either Pedro or Susana, remembering 
that Susana always plays first. If no swaps are required, the output should display the message 
(without quotes) "Empate" (Tie).
