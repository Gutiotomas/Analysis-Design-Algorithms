In Geography, the antipode (from the Greek "anti": "opposite" and "podos": "foot") is the point on 
the Earth's surface that is diametrically opposite to a particular position. In other words, it 
corresponds to the farthest possible destination given a point of origin.

For example, the antipode of Bahía Blanca (Argentina) is Lianyungang (China), while the antipode of Hamilton (New Zealand) 
is Córdoba (Spain), or the antipode of Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile) is Jaisalmer (India).

In this problem, however, we are going to think of the antipode in a different way. Given a sequence of N strings 
(not necessarily distinct), the antipode of A will be B if and only if, when the sequence is sorted in ascending order, 
the position of A is 𝑖 and the position of B is 𝑁−𝑖+1 (where 1≤𝑖≤𝑁).

What we need to do, then, is, given a value 𝑖, return the values of A and B separated by a space.

Input
The input begins with a line containing two integers 𝑁 (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) and 𝐶 (1 ≤ C ≤ 20), separated by a space. 
Then follows a line with 𝑁 strings separated by spaces, each composed of no more than 4 uppercase letters (A - Z). 
After that, there are 𝐶 lines, each containing the value 𝑖 (1 ≤ i ≤ N).

Output
The output should contain a single line with the corresponding values of A and B for each query.

Example:
Input
5 3
A B C D E
2
1
4

Output
B D
A E
D B
