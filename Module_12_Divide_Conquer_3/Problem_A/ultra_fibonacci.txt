What if I don’t underestimate your abilities by asking for the N-th term of the Fibonacci series? 
Well, how about this: what if N is large?

But to avoid issues with storing large values, we'll simplify it a bit: instead of showing the full term, 
you'll need to show the remainder of the division between that term and 999999937.

Let's consider modular arithmetic: (a * b) % c = (a % c * b % c) % c
Where % is the remainder operation (also known as modulus).

Input
The input starts with a line containing the number C of test cases, no more than 20. 
Then follow C lines, each with the corresponding value of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1E10).

Output
For each test case, output a single line with the remainder of the division between the corresponding 
Fibonacci term and 999999937.
