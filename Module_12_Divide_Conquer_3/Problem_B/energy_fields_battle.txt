Let’s imagine the following situation: in a two-dimensional field, there is a finite number of combat robots. 
Each robot has a force field around it, and if the force fields of two or more robots intersect, 
they are destroyed by the collision. Let's assume that these force fields are square-shaped, 
with the center being the robot's position in the 2D space.

What would be the maximum size of these force fields (all of them are the same size) so that no destruction occurs? 
In other words, what is the maximum size of the squares such that no pair intersects (they can touch, but not intersect)?

To keep the problem simple, assume that the sides of the squares are always parallel to the X and Y axes.

Input
The input starts with a line containing the number of test cases, no more than 20. After that, each case 
starts with a line containing the number N of robots (2 ≤ N ≤ 20000), followed by N lines corresponding to 
the positions of each robot. Each position corresponds to a pair (x, y), both being integers in the range 
[-10^6, 10^6]. No two robots are in exactly the same position.

Output
For each test case, output a single line with the positive integer value corresponding to the maximum size 
of the square (side length).
