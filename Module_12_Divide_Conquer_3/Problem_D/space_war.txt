In a galaxy far, far away, there is a rivalry between two factions that hate each other to the death: 
the Galactic United League (LGU) and the Interplanetary Allied Community (CAI). 
Countless planets belong to one faction, and others belong to the opposing faction. 
For centuries, a truce has prevented aggression, but rumors say that a war is imminent, 
and all it takes is for two rival planets to start fighting for a full-scale war to break out. 
The closer two rival planets are, the higher the probability that they will be the ones to start the war.

Input
The input consists of several test cases, no more than 5. Each test case begins with a line that 
contains the number N of planets (2 ≤ N ≤ 20000). Then follow N lines that correspond to the 
information of each planet. This information contains three values separated by a blank space. 
The first two values correspond to the position of the planet in a 2D plane (it should be 3D, 
but with an imminent war, this detail loses importance), both being positive integers no greater than 40000. 
No two planets are in the same position. The third value indicates the faction to which the planet belongs: 
"LGU" for the Galactic United League or "CAI" for the Interplanetary Allied Community. 
The input ends with a value of N = 0, which should not be processed.

Output
For each test case, the output should display on a single line the shortest distance between 
two rival planets. This value should be rounded to one decimal place, using 
a dot as the decimal separator. If there are no rival planets in the test case, you should display 
the message (without quotes) "INF".

Example:
Input
4
1 1 CAI
10 1 LGU
1 2 CAI
3 2 LGU
2
3 3 LGU
4 4 LGU
0

Output
2.0
INF
