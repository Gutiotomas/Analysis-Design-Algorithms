I don't know if you already knew this, but the planets in our solar system were named by ancient civilizations as
a way to honor their gods.
 
For example, the Babylonians knew the closest planet to the Sun as Nabu, in honor of their god of writing and
destiny, while the ancient Greeks called it Stilbon, and their more modern descendants named it Hermes, after
the messenger of the Olympian gods, due to how fast it moves across the sky (it takes only 88 days to complete
an orbit around the Sun, traveling at almost 48 kilometers per second, faster than any other planet). The Romans
named it after the equivalent god in their mythology: Mercury.

Meanwhile, thanks to its distinctive brightness (due to its proximity and the density of its atmosphere, 
it's the third brightest celestial object in our sky after the Sun and Moon) and its appearance at dawn, 
the ancient Romans associated the second planet with Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, while the Greeks 
linked it with their equivalent goddess, Aphrodite.

Let’s suppose that, consistent with this "divine" origin, the ancient Greeks referred to "Olympus Day" as 
the day when all planets are perfectly aligned.

If today such an event were to occur, and we also knew the exact time in days it takes for each planet to 
complete its orbit, how many days would be left until the next occurrence of this celestial alignment? 
Consider that, for our solar system, we might not necessarily be interested in the alignment of all nine 
planets (something that probably won’t happen before the universe ends), but in the alignment of any subset 
of two or more planets. We could even be interested in any other system with a single sun.

Input:
The first line of the input contains the number 𝑁 of cases, no more than 500. The next 𝑁 lines each 
contain between 2 and 5 positive integers (not greater than 5000) separated by spaces, representing 
the orbital periods of each planet in days (these values are not necessarily ordered by the planet’s distance from the sun).

Output:
The output should contain 𝑁 lines, each showing the number of days until the next Olympus Day.
