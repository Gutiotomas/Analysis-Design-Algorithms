The Prime Number Theorem (PNT) is a statement that describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers, formalizing the intuitive idea that primes 
become less frequent as numbers grow larger. The theorem was proposed by Carl Friedrich Gauss between 1792 and 1793, then by Adrien-Marie Legendre 
in 1798, and later refined by Gauss.

Given P(n) as a function that denotes the count of prime numbers less than or equal to 𝑛, the theorem states that:

P(n)∼ n / ln(n)​
 
This means that the number of primes up to 𝑛 is approximately n/ln(n), where ln is the natural logarithm of 𝑛.

Problem
For a given value of 𝑛, you are asked to compute the error 𝑒 between the actual number of primes 𝑃(𝑛) and Gauss’s approximation:

e=P(n)− n/ln(n)
 
Input
The input begins with a line containing the number of test cases 𝐶 (no more than 10,000). Then, 𝐶 lines follow, each containing a value of 𝑛 (where 10<n<100,000).

Output
For each test case, the output should consist of 𝐶 lines, each containing the corresponding error 𝑒, rounded to the nearest integer.
