According to critics, the best battle in The Lord of the Rings, and probably one of the best in cinema in general, 
is the one that takes place outside the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith. In this battle, which also features the 
unforgettable duel between Éowyn and the Witch-King of Angmar, a massive army of 200,000 orcs and trolls strikes 
fear into their enemies.

Sauron is very meticulous, so he wants to divide this army into battalions of exactly the same number of "soldiers." 
The thing is, there are many ways to make this distribution: he could have 20 battalions of 10,000 each, or 50 battalions 
of 4,000 each, among other possibilities.

Poor Sauron! Given the size of his army (not just for this battle but for others as well), could you help him determine 
the number of possible exact distributions, knowing that the minimum size of a battalion is one soldier?

Input:
The first line of the input contains the number 𝑁 of cases, no more than 100. The following 𝑁 lines each contain
a positive integer 𝐸, corresponding to the size of the army (2 ≤ 𝐸 ≤ 500,000).

Output:
The output should consist of 𝑁 lines, each containing the number of different distributions.

Example:
Input
4
200000
25
10000
9887

Output
