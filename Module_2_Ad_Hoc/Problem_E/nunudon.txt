The following is the NuNuDoN Sequence (N plus Number of Divisors of N):

𝑁0=1
𝑁𝑖=𝑁𝑖−1+𝐷(𝑁𝑖−1) for 𝑖>0, where 𝐷(𝑥) represents the number of divisors of 𝑥.

Thus, the first six terms of this sequence would be: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 12.

The problem is, given two integer values 𝐴 and 𝐵 (𝐴<𝐵), to find the number of terms in this sequence that lie
within the range [𝐴,𝐵].

Input
The first line of the input contains the number 𝑁 of test cases, not exceeding 100. The following 𝑁 lines each 
contain two integers separated by a space (1≤𝐴<𝐵≤100000).
Output
For each test case, output a single integer representing the number of terms in the sequence that fall within 
the corresponding range.

Example:
Input
3
1 12
1 100
65 70

Output
6
20
0
