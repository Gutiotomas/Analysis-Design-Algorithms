A number is defined as an heir if it retains the same digits as its parents after they are multiplied. 
For example, 2187 is an heir number, whose parents are 81 and 27 (81 × 27 = 2187). More formally, we say that 
a positive integer is an heir if it satisfies the following three conditions:

It has an even number of digits.
It is the product of two parent numbers, each having half as many digits as its heir.
It inherits all the digits of its parents, in the same quantities, but not necessarily in the same order.

Input
The input begins with a positive integer 𝐶 on a single line, no greater than 50, which represents the number
 of test cases. Then follow 𝐶 lines, each with a positive integer less than 1𝐸9.

Output
The output should contain 𝐶 lines, each with the message (without quotes) "Heredero" or "No", depending on the result.
