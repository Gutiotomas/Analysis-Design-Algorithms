Every country issues a public document to allow the personal and unequivocal identification of its citizens. 
For example, in Colombia, this document is called "C√©dula de Ciudadan√≠a" (CC), while in Brazil it is called 
"Registro Geral" (RG), and in Spain, Argentina, Honduras, and Peru it is called "Documento Nacional de Identidad" (DNI).

In all cases, this document contains a unique identifier, which is numeric in some countries and alphanumeric in others.

In the case of Spain, for example, the DNI contains eight digits followed by a verification character, which is a 
capital letter. It is called a verification character because, when the eight-digit number is divided by 23, the 
remainder must correspond to a unique letter as follows:

For example, if the eight digits are 76543210, the remainder of the integer division by 23 is 15, so the verification 
character would be 'S', and the complete DNI would be 76543210S.

Suppose we have a photo of a DNI, but the resolution is poor, and one or more digits of the DNI are not visible. 
The problem, then, is to determine how many DNIs would be compatible.

For example, if the photo reads 1234?670Y, where '?' represents the digit that is not visible, the only possible 
digit for that position is 5 because no other digit would result in the verification character 'Y'.

Input
The input begins with a positive integer ùê∂ on a single line, no greater than 20, which represents the number of test cases.
Then, ùê∂ lines follow, each with a DNI where at least one and no more than five digits are missing (represented by '?').

Output
The output should contain ùê∂ lines, each with the number of compatible DNIs.
