Beri (also called "Beli," "Berri," "Belly," "Berry," or "Berries") is the currency unit of the world of One Piece, 
symbolized by the sign "."

The different denominations of bills and coins are as follows: 10000, 5000, 1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5, 1

When a pirate crew acquires a treasure, they split the earnings among the crew members. However, there is one crew 
that is very picky and insists that, given a certain amount, it should be distributed with the minimum possible number 
of bills and/or coins. For example, if the amount is 8000, any other crew would not mind receiving 8 bills of 1000, 
but for this crew, it would be essential to receive exactly 1 bill of 5000 and 3 bills of 1000. Can you help them with 
this task?
