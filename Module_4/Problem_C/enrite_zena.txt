Enrite is a programmer who, like many others, has become addicted to energy drinks. He spends hours and hours in front 
of his computer consuming nothing but energy drinks, which, of course, is not good for his health.

It turns out that Enrite's favorite energy drink has launched an advertising campaign: every drink bottle has a positive 
integer no greater than 999 printed inside the cap. If two caps have values that sum up to at least 1000, they can be 
exchanged for a free drink. Enrite has been collecting caps all year long, and now it’s time to redeem them. However, 
being a programmer, he wants to write a program to maximize the number of drinks he can get.

By the way, Enrite’s last name is Zena, which is quite curious considering that “enrite zena” is a palindrome of the 
word “energizante” (which means energy drink in Spanish).

Input
The input starts with a line containing a positive integer 𝐶, which corresponds to the number of test cases (no more than 5). 
Each test case begins with a line containing the number 𝑁 of caps Enrite has (no more than 50000). Then 𝑁 lines follow, 
each with the value of a cap.

Output
For each test case, there should be a single line with the maximum number of drinks Enrite can redeem.
