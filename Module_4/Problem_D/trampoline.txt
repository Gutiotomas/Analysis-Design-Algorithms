Mayor McDaniels from South Park, aiming to keep the kids in the town occupied, has decided to rent a trampoline
for public use. The problem is that all the kids are very picky and each one wants to use it at a specific time, 
or earlier if possible, and they throw a huge tantrum if they have to use it at a later time.

Not all kids throw tantrums for the same duration. For example, Eric Cartman is capable of throwing a fit for hours 
on end, while others like Wendy are less troublesome and throw fits for only a few minutes.

Given that each kid will have a 10-minute turn on the trampoline and it’s impossible to satisfy everyone’s wishes, 
how can the mayor, at the very least, minimize the total tantrum time?

Input
The input begins with a single positive integer no greater than 5, which represents the number of test cases. 
Each test case starts with a line containing the number 𝑁 of kids (1≤N≤5000). Then, 𝑁 lines follow, each containing
two positive integers separated by a space: the time 𝑡𝑖 when the 𝑖-th kid wants to start using the trampoline (0≤𝑡𝑖≤10N), 
and the time 𝑝𝑖 they will throw a tantrum if they have to wait (1≤𝑝𝑖≤240). Both values are expressed in minutes, 
and in the case of 𝑡𝑖, it is always a multiple of 10 because the turns are in 10-minute intervals.

Output
For each test case, you must display a single line with the minimum total tantrum time that can be achieved.
