These are the last holidays that Gordie will spend with his family (to find out why, you will need to watch the movie 
What we did on our holiday http://youtu.be/wWBMeQRYYa8). The thing is, he wants to spend some time alone with as many 
family members as possible. However, there are three problems:

He only has one long weekend with a holiday Monday to do so.
Each family member has a specific, unbreakable time requirement for when they want to meet and for how long.
The minimum duration is one minute.
Gordie also needs to sleep, so he can't attend to anyone between midnight and six in the morning (in other words, he can 
only meet someone until 12 a.m. or starting from 6 a.m.).
Input
The input begins with a line containing the integer 𝐶 representing the number of test cases, no more than 20. 
Each case starts with a line containing a positive integer 𝐹, no greater than 5000, which represents the number of 
family members. This is followed by 𝐹 lines, each with three values separated by spaces: the day (without accents) 
either "sabado", "domingo", or "lunes", the start time when the family member wants to meet Gordie in the format 
hh:mm (with ℎ between 00 and 23, and 𝑚 between 00 and 59), and the duration in minutes for the meeting.

Output
The output should contain 𝐶 lines, each with the corresponding maximum number of family members Gordie can meet.
