That highly anticipated time of year has arrived. Everyone is excited and preparing their best outfits. 
It's not Christmas, nor Halloween—it's comic-con.

If you didn't know, comic-con is a multi-day event celebrated in many cities around the world, based on the 
format that began nearly 50 years ago in San Diego, California, USA. While comics are clearly an important part, 
the general theme can be said to be entertainment, covering other arts such as cinema, anime, video games, and more. 
In addition to seminars and workshops, there are usually presentations of upcoming releases, meet-and-greets with 
famous artists, cosplay contests, and much more.

María José never misses any comic-con in her city, and this year is no exception. She has been looking at the 
schedule and wants to attend all the activities, but the problem is that there are so many that some overlap in time, 
meaning she can't attend them all. That's why she has tasked herself with convincing her friends to attend the 
activities she can't go to, so that together they can cover all of them.

Given the list of activities, where the start and end times are known, could you help María José calculate how 
many friends she needs at a minimum to cover all the activities? You must consider three things:

A person cannot be in more than one activity at the same time.

The activities must be attended in their entirety, not partially.

You can assume that the time required to travel from the location of one activity to another is zero.

Input
The input contains several test cases, no more than 5. Each case begins with a positive integer 𝑁, no greater 
than 10000, which corresponds to the number of activities. This is followed by 𝑁 lines, one for each activity, 
containing two positive integers no greater than 1E6, separated by a space: the start and end times of the activity. 
The second value is strictly greater than the first. These times are interpreted as the number of minutes 
counted from time zero, which is when the comic-con begins. A case with no activities, 𝑁=0, indicates the end of 
the input and should not be processed.

Output
For each test case, the output should contain a single line with the corresponding minimum number of friends required.
