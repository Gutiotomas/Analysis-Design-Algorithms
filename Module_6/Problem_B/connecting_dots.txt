Jerónimo is a very particular child. In preschool, while all his classmates are doing the exercise of 
connecting dots according to instructions to form a figure, he does something very different. 
He doesn't care if a "figure" can or cannot magically form; what he really cares about is saving as 
much of his precious pencil graphite as possible. That’s why, instead of following the suggested sequence of dots, 
he draws straight lines between one point and another until he connects them all, but in a way that uses as 
little pencil as possible.

For example, while his classmates with the following sequence of points:

                                            .
                                          .   .
                                           . .

Form the star of 5 points but Juanito, on the other hand, draws the following lines:

                                            .
                                          ./ \.
                                           ._./

Input
The input begins with a single positive integer on a line, no greater than 10, indicating the 
number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing the number 𝑁 of points (1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 100). 
Then follow 𝑁 lines, each containing two real values separated by a space representing the coordinates 
𝑥,𝑦 (in an arbitrary unit of measurement) of each point (-1000 ≤ 𝑥,𝑦 ≤ 1000).

Output
For each test case, output a single line with the minimum total length, with one decimal place, 
of the lines that connect all the points.
