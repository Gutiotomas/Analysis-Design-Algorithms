The government of a newly established nation in a territory where there was practically nothing before, 
has created the infrastructure office to meet the needs of the citizens. As its first task, this office 
must connect the country's major cities. To assist in this task, the planning and territory office has 
provided a map with all the possible roads that could be built between one city and another, along with 
the corresponding cost.

The problem is that, due to the geography of the country, there are regions that are isolated from others 
by land, so in addition to roads, the construction of airports will be necessary. The good news is that, 
regardless of where they are built (in which cities), the cost of an airport is practically constant.

Considering this scenario, and knowing that the government's goal is for any citizen to be able to travel 
from any city to any other by land or air, what should the infrastructure office's plan be (which airports 
and which roads to build) in order to minimize the total cost? An additional restriction is that at least 
one airport must be built in the country; otherwise, how could they travel abroad?

Input
The input begins with a single positive integer on one line, no greater than 20, which represents the number 
of test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing three positive integer values separated by spaces: 
the number 𝑁 of cities (1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 80), the number 𝑀 of possible roads (1 ≤ 𝑀 ≤ 1000), and the cost 𝐴 of building an 
airport (1 ≤ 𝐴 ≤ 50000). Then, 𝑀 lines follow, each with three integer values separated by spaces corresponding 
to the identifiers of the two cities 𝐴 and 𝐵 that would be connected bidirectionally by the road (cities are 
identified from 1 to 𝑁, and a pair of cities does not appear more than once), followed by the cost 𝑅 of the road 
(1 ≤𝑅 ≤ 20000).

Output
For each test case, output a single line with the minimum total cost along with the number of airports that 
should be built. These two values should be separated by a space.
