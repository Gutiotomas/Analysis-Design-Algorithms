Super Mario Bros. is a platform video game, perhaps the most famous in the world, designed by Shigeru Miyamoto, 
released on September 13, 1985, and produced by the company Nintendo. The game describes the adventures of the 
brothers Mario and Luigi, who must rescue Princess Peach from the Mushroom Kingdom, who has been kidnapped by 
the king of the Koopas, Bowser.

An important part of the game is the pipes or warp pipes, from which Piranha Plants can emerge, but their most 
interesting function is that they allow players to travel to certain sections of the game, either to collect 
coins and other items or to shorten their path.

Let’s assume that the players want to go from an access pipe to a destination pipe, but to do so, they can pass 
through a set of interconnected intermediate pipes. Given 𝑁 pipes identified from 0 to 𝑁−1, where the first is 
the origin and the last is the destination, and where each connection between pipes has a flow capacity 
(expressed in some unit of mushrooms/second), what is the maximum flow in that same unit that can exit through 
the destination pipe?

Input
The input begins with a line containing a positive integer 𝐶 representing the number of test cases, no more than 5. 
Each test case starts with a line containing two positive integer values separated by a space: the number 
𝑁 of pipes (accesses) and the number 𝑀 of connections between them (2≤𝑁≤500;1≤𝑀≤ 𝑁(𝑁−1)/2). Then, 𝑀 lines follow, 
each with three values separated by spaces: the first two correspond to the identifiers of the source and destination 
pipes of each connection, while the third corresponds to its capacity, which is a positive integer not exceeding 1000. 
There will be at most one unidirectional connection between two different pipes, and no circular connections 
(same source and destination).

Output
For each test case, there must be a single line with the maximum flow for that case.
