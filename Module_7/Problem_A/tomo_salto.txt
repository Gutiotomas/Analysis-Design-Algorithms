Tomo o Salto is a board game, perhaps the most unpopular in the world due to its simplicity. 
It is similar to the game of snakes and ladders in the sense that the player moves through sequential spaces, 
but instead of moving in both X and Y directions, they only move in one direction. In other words, it doesn't 
resemble a grid but rather an array. Moreover, each space has no figure, no wildcard, no trap, nothing, just a 
non-negative integer value.

The game is played as follows: starting at the first space (let’s say the one on the far left, moving towards the right), 
the player decides whether to "take" that space or "skip" it. If they take it, they accumulate the value of that space 
and move to the next one. If they skip it, they accumulate nothing and move to the next space. This process repeats 
from the current space until the player reaches space 
𝑁
N, which is the one farthest to the right. The objective of the game is to accumulate the maximum possible value, 
but there’s one rule: if you take a space and had previously taken the one immediately to its left, the value taken 
in the previous move is lost, meaning you must subtract it from the accumulated score.

Obviously, without this rule, besides being simple, the game would be stupid because you could just take all 𝑁 spaces 
and be done. Instead, what you need to do is make the correct decisions (take or skip) in such a way as to maximize the 
final accumulation.

For example, if there are 4 spaces with values: 2, 1, 3, 4, the optimal decisions would be "take, skip, take, take" or 
"take, skip, skip, take," and the accumulated score in both cases would be 6.

Input
The input begins with a line containing the number of cases, no more than 50. Each case begins with a line containing 
a positive integer 𝑁 (not greater than 1E6) representing the number of spaces. Then, 𝑁 lines follow, each containing 
a non-negative integer value not exceeding 1E9.

Output
The output must contain a single line with the highest possible score.
