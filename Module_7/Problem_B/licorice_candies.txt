The essential ingredients for making licorice candies are the extract from the licorice plant (Glycyrrhiza glabra),
sugar, and a thickening agent, which can be starch, flour, gum arabic, or gelatin. These candies are well-known worldwide, 
and their most common form is a spirally coiled tube. They also come in various colors, although in Europe, black is the 
most common, while in the United States, they are usually red on the outside and white on the inside.

It turns out that the retail market for these candies (in stores and street stalls), at least in their tubular form, 
is quite peculiar. The thickness is constant, around a quarter of an inch, while the lengths can vary between one inch 
and any multiple of this, depending on the customer's choice, but the price per inch is not constant. In other words, 
a licorice candy that is two inches long will not necessarily cost twice as much as a one-inch candy, and so on.

If the prices for all lengths between 1 and 𝑁 inches are known, and each customer decides the length to buy 
(only multiples of an inch), would you help a store with a candy of length 𝑁 to know, if it sells the entire candy, 
what are the minimum and maximum total sales values it could receive?

Input
The input begins with a line containing the number 𝐶 of test cases, no more than 5. Then 𝐶 lines follow, 
each starting with the value of 𝑁 (1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 500), followed by a space, and then 𝑁 positive integer values, 
no greater than 1E6, separated by spaces, which correspond to the sale prices for each length.

Output
The output must contain 𝐶 lines, each with the minimum and maximum values for each test case, separated by a space.

Example:

Input
3
2 150 200
5 10 20 30 40 50
5 20 30 50 90 100

Output
200 300
50 50
80 110
