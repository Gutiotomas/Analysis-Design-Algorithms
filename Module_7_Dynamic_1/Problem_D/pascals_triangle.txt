This famous triangle has been analyzed long, long ago and has been given several names. Its properties were discussed, 
for example, by the Persian mathematicians Al-Karaji (953–1029) and Omar Khayyám (1048–1131), and in the Persian realm, 
it was known as Khayyám's triangle.

Later, in the 13th century, it was introduced in China by Yang Hui (1238–1298), where it became known as Yang Hui's triangle, 
while the first record of the triangle in Europe came with Petrus Apianus (1495–1552). However, a little later, in Italy, 
it became known as Tartaglia's triangle, in honor of the Italian algebraist Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia (1500–1577).

So, when did it take the name we know it by today? In his book Traité du triangle arithmétique (Treatise on the 
Arithmetic Triangle) published in 1654, Blaise Pascal gathered several known results about the triangle and used 
them to solve problems related to probability theory. However, it was not until 1708 that Pierre Rémond, marquis 
de Montmort, known for his work on calculating the probabilities of gambling games, called it: "Table of Mr. Pascal 
for combinations." Later in 1730, it was named Triangulum Arithmeticum Pascalianum (Pascal's Arithmetic Triangle) 
by Abraham de Moivre, a French mathematician famous for predicting the date of his death through a statistical calculation.

Now, what is this triangle all about? By adding two adjacent elements, the result will be the element located just 
below the two. This rule applies to all elements except for the diagonals that start from the 1 at the top of the 
triangle, which all have a value of 1.

An interesting consequence of Pascal's triangle is that the sum of all values in a row is a power of 2. 
This is because, by the binomial theorem, the expansion of the n-th power of (1+1)^𝑛=2^𝑛 is:
|𝑛| + |𝑛| + ... + |𝑛| + |𝑛| = 2^𝑛
|0|   |1|        |n-1|  |n|
 
Given a Pascal's triangle of height ℎ (1 ≤ h ≤ 500), could you write a program to determine the maximum value contained in it?

To simplify the problem a bit so you don't have issues storing values, instead of showing the complete value, 
you should display the remainder of the integer division between that term and 999999937. But note that when 
we refer to "the maximum value," it is the maximum before taking the remainder, not after.

Consider that by modular arithmetic: 
(𝑎+𝑏)%𝑐=(𝑎%𝑐+𝑏%𝑐)%𝑐
Where % is the remainder operation (also called modulo).

Input
The input starts with a line containing the number 𝐶 of test cases, no more than 100. Then follow 𝐶 lines, 
each with a value for ℎ.

Output
For each test case, the output should contain a line with the corresponding maximum value.

Example:

Input

Output
