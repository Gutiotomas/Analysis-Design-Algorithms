Like many people in this country, Lucia and Felipe have to hustle daily to make a living. Also, like many others, 
they decided to perform juggling acts at traffic lights, hoping to entertain passing drivers and receive a small 
financial reward in return.

To save themselves the trouble of dividing the money collected after each performance, Lucia and Felipe decided it 
was more practical to pool everything collected during the day and only divide it at the end. The problem is that 
at the end of the day, they end up with a bag full of coins (nobody gives bills), and it's not always easy to split 
the total exactly in half.

Input
The input starts with an integer representing the number ùê∂ of test cases (no more than 5). Then follow ùê∂ lines, 
each with between 1 and 100 values separated by a space. These values correspond to the coins collected, and we 
assume that the denominations of these coins can be any positive integer multiple of 10, with no value greater than 500.

Output
For each test case, you must display on a single line the minimum difference (in absolute value) that results from 
the coin distribution.

Example:

Input
3
10 20 40 60
20 30 50
70 100 70 100 80

Output
10
