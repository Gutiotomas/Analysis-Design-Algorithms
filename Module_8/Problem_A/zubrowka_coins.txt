The Republic of Zubrowka, located in Eastern Europe, is a fictional country where The Grand Budapest Hotel is set, 
the movie directed by Wes Anderson, inspired by the works of Austrian writer Stefan Zweig, and starring Ralph Fiennes.

You may not have noticed during the movie, but in addition to the Euro, another currency called the Zubrowkian pound 
is used in Zubrowka, which has three peculiarities. The first is that there are no coins, only bills. The second is 
that the denominations do not follow a pattern like in other countries, and the third is that from time to time, 
the General Bank of Zubrowka decides to change the denomination system, although it always keeps one pound as the 
smallest denomination.

Given the denomination system at a specific moment in Zubrowka and an integer amount 𝑀, could you determine the minimum
 number of bills required to form that amount?

Input
The input starts with a positive integer representing the number 𝐶 of test cases (no more than 10). Then follow 𝐶 lines, 
each starting with the amount 𝑀 (1 ≤ M ≤ 5000), followed by a space, and then the denomination system: between 1 and 20 
positive integer values in ascending order, separated by a space.

Output
The output should contain 𝐶 lines, each with the minimum number of bills required.

Example:
Input
2
1000 1 3
100 1 50 95

Output
334
