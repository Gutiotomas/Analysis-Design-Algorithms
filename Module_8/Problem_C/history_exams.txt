The final exam in a human history course consists of arranging a series of important events in chronological order. 
Students who arrange all the events in the exact order receive a perfect score, but how do you grade those who did 
not respond in the exact order?

One common alternative is to give a point for each event located in the correct position. Another alternative is to 
give a point for each event that is in the correct relative order. In both cases, the final score will be equal to 
the sum of points. Note that in both cases, a perfect score would mean a number of points equal to the number of 
events to be arranged. For example, if the correct order of 3 consecutively numbered events is 1 2 3, a student A 
with response 1 2 3 would receive a score of 100% (perfect), while a student B with response 1 3 2 would receive a 
score of 33% with the first alternative (only event 1 would be located correctly), while with the second alternative 
they would receive a score of 67% (events 1 and 2 or 1 and 3 would be in the correct relative order).

Input
The input starts with a positive integer 𝐶, no greater than 5, corresponding to the number of test cases. 
Each test case starts with a line containing a positive integer 𝐸, no greater than 20, corresponding to the number 
of exams to grade, followed by 𝐸+1 lines, the first one with the events corresponding to the perfect answer, 
and the remaining with the students' responses. In each of these 𝐸+1 lines, there will be 𝑁 (1 ≤ N ≤ 60) different 
positive numbers, between 1 and 𝑁, separated by a space.

Output
Each test case starts with a single line with the message (without quotes): "caso i:" where 𝑖 is the consecutive number 
of the case. Then follow 𝐸 lines with the corresponding exam scores according to the second alternative explained above, 
rounded to the nearest integer. Between test cases, there will be an empty line, but there will be no empty line after 
the last case.
