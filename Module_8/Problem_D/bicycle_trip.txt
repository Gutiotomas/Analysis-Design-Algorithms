Dad, dad, for my 18th birthday, I want you to let me bike around the country.

But Daniela, how could you think of that? You’re too young, that adventure could be very long and dangerous.

Look, dad, in 2020, 19-year-old Zara Rutherford, a Belgian-British pilot, became the youngest person to fly 
an airplane across 52 countries on five continents over five months.

Yes, but...

Dad, wait: In 2010, 16-year-old Jessica Watson from Australia became the youngest navigator to sail around the world. 
You can see it in the movie "True Spirit." Are you going to tell me that I can't at least bike around the country?

After thinking about it for a long time, Daniela’s dad finally said:

Okay, you can do it, but with one condition: You must choose the starting and destination cities for your adventure in 
such a way that one is reachable from the other. Once you've decided, you must use the shortest route between them. Deal?
After agreeing, Daniela took a map to plan her trip. To her surprise, the two cities farthest apart from each other weren’t 
necessarily the ones with the longest route possible because it depends on the roads between them. Given a list of cities and 
the road distances between them, can you help Daniela choose the two cities that maximize her journey while fulfilling 
her dad’s restriction?

Input
The input consists of a series of test cases, no more than 5. Each test case starts with a line containing a positive integer 
𝑁, no greater than 50, which corresponds to the number of cities. Then follow 𝑁 lines with the distance matrix 
between the cities. 
The cities are identified by integer values from 1 to 
𝑁, and in each line, the distance values are presented as positive integers no greater than 500, separated by spaces. 
The matrix is symmetric, with the diagonal values being zero, and if there is no road between city 𝑖 and city 𝑗, 
a hyphen ('-') will appear in the matrix. There will be at least two cities connected.

Output
For each test case, the output should contain a line with the longest possible distance of the shortest route 
between two cities.
