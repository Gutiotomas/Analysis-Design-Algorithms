A palindrome (from the Greek palin dromein, meaning "to go back") is a word, number, or phrase that reads the same 
forward and backward. In the case of numbers, they are also known as capicúa numbers, but let’s focus on words, 
or more specifically, strings of characters. For example, "Ana" is a palindrome, while "Pedro" is not. However, 
any string can be transformed into a palindrome with a finite number of operations. Consider the following three operations:

Add a character
Remove a character
Replace a character
To transform "abccda" into a palindrome, one could, for instance, add two characters 
('d' in position 3 and then 'b' in position 7), or replace 'b' with 'd' (or equivalently, 'd' with 'b').

Assume that each of the three operations costs the same, one unit. The problem, therefore, is to find the least 
expensive way to transform a given string into a palindrome.

Input
The input begins with a positive integer 𝑁, representing the number of test cases (no more than 10). Then, there are 
𝑁 lines, each containing a string of characters composed only of lowercase letters. The length of these strings is 
at most 200 characters.

Output
The output should contain 𝑁 lines, each with the minimum number of operations required to convert the 
corresponding string into a palindrome.

Example:
Input
3
asa
coco
piedra

Output
